write a blog on the difference between document and widow object?

WINDOW object and DOCUMENT object ARE NOT THE SAME!!!!!

the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties 
like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually
 gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
